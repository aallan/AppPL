AppPL
=====

In-App Monitoring library for iOS, see: http://iam.watchmouse.com/

The App Performance Library (AppPL) enables developers of mobile applications on iOS, and other mobile platforms, to collect performance data of their apps “in the wild.” AppPL collects performance data in apps and communicates these to a remote web service, which collects and aggregates the data, and can provide periodical reports, identify problems, and optionally send alerts. Typically, AppPL is used to track performance, and errors, of API calls, as in most apps these calls affect the actual performance the most.
